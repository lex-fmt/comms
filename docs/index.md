# Welcome to lex

lex is a plain text document format designed for the complete lifecycle of an idea. It scales from a fleeting thought to a finished thesis, from a line of code to a novel.

## Core Philosophy

lex is built on the principle that structure should be visible, intuitive, and effortless. By leveraging spatial layout (indentation) and a minimal set of unambiguous markers, the format becomes nearly invisible, allowing you to focus entirely on your ideas.

## A Taste of lex

```
A Place For Ideas

1. The Cage of Compromise

    We know of nothing more powerful than an idea, and no denser
    medium for it than written language.

    Key problems with current formats:
        - Plain text: simple but unstructured
        - Word processors: features but brittle formats
        - Academic systems: structure but no fluidity

2. A Native Habitat for Ideas

    What if a format could be a habitat, not a cage?

    - Simple at the Start: As easy as a plain text note.
    - Structured as it Grows: Gains hierarchy as ideas develop.
    - Readable by Anyone: No special training required.
```

Structure emerges from indentation. No tags, no complex syntax.

## Key Features
